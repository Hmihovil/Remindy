# Remindy #

Set and track as many tasks as you want, be them long term or short. Organize your life goals and TODO lists with Remindy! Add images, text, lists and more to your Tasks. Want to set deadlines to your tasks? Remindy has you covered with -for now- three types of reminders:

- One-time reminders. For tasks which have a set deadline.
- Repeating reminders. For tasks which repeat either daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
- Location-based reminders. Remindy will notify you about these whenever you get or leave a set place -like your Home, or your Work- anywhere in the world!

Remindy allows for rich multimedia to be attached to any Task. Some of the available attachments include: Lists, Text, Images, Recordings and Links!
